    <h2>Black Women Apperecation</h2>

    <p>
      Being a black woman is hard in the world. That's why it's important that we continue to grow as a community and build each other up.
      I see black women breaking each other down too much always feeling like they're in competition with each other when they see one another doing good.
      Instead they begin to try to tear one another down that needs to change because so many other nations are agasinst blacks. Do you know why blacks continue to fail?
      Blacks continue to fail because for one it's your lifestyle if in your own house ya'll practice negative energry and breaking one another.

      Instead blacks needs to build each other up and be more postive with one another.
